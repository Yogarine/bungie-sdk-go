	// I regret calling this a \"large icon\". It's more like a medium-sized image with a picture of the vendor's mug on it, trying their best to look cool. Not what one would call an icon.
	LargeIcon string `json:"largeIcon,omitempty"`
	Subtitle string `json:"subtitle,omitempty"`
	// If we replaced the icon with something more glitzy, this is the original icon that the vendor had according to the game's content. It may be more lame and/or have less razzle-dazzle. But who am I to tell you which icon to use.
	OriginalIcon string `json:"originalIcon,omitempty"`
	// Vendors, in addition to expected display property data, may also show some \"common requirements\" as statically defined definition data. This might be when a vendor accepts a single type of currency, or when the currency is unique to the vendor and the designers wanted to show that currency when you interact with the vendor.
	RequirementsDisplay []DestinyDefinitionsDestinyVendorRequirementDisplayEntryDefinition `json:"requirementsDisplay,omitempty"`
	// This is the icon used in parts of the game UI such as the vendor's waypoint.
	SmallTransparentIcon string `json:"smallTransparentIcon,omitempty"`
	// This is the icon used in the map overview, when the vendor is located on the map.
	MapIcon string `json:"mapIcon,omitempty"`
	// This is apparently the \"Watermark\". I am not certain offhand where this is actually used in the Game UI, but some people may find it useful.
	LargeTransparentIcon string `json:"largeTransparentIcon,omitempty"`
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Note that \"icon\" is sometimes misleading, and should be interpreted in the context of the entity. For instance, in Destiny 1 the DestinyRecordBookDefinition's icon was a big picture of a book.  But usually, it will be a small square image that you can use as... well, an icon.
