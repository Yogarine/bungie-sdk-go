// A milestone may have one or more conceptual Activities associated with it, and each of those conceptual activities could have a variety of variants, modes, tiers, what-have-you. Our attempts to determine what qualifies as a conceptual activity are, unfortunately, janky. So if you see missing modes or modes that don't seem appropriate to you, let us know and I'll buy you a beer if we ever meet up in person.
type DestinyMilestonesDestinyPublicMilestoneActivity struct {
	// The hash identifier of the activity that's been chosen to be considered the canonical \"conceptual\" activity definition. This may have many variants, defined herein.

	// The activity may have 0-to-many modifiers: if it does, this will contain the hashes to the DestinyActivityModifierDefinition that defines the modifier being applied.

	// The hash identifier of the most specific Activity Mode under which this activity is played. This is useful for situations where the activity in question is - for instance - a PVP map, but it's not clear what mode the PVP map is being played under. If it's a playlist, this will be less specific: but hopefully useful in some way.
