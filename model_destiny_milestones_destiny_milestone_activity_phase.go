package bungie

// Represents whatever information we can return about an explicit phase in an activity. In the future, I hope we'll have more than just \"guh, you done gone and did something,\" but for the forseeable future that's all we've got. I'm making it more than just a list of booleans out of that overly-optimistic hope.

	// Indicates if the phase has been completed.
	Complete bool `json:"complete,omitempty"`
	// In DestinyActivityDefinition, if the activity has phases, there will be a set of phases defined in the \"insertionPoints\" property. This is the hash that maps to that phase.
